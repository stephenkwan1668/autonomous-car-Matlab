# autonomous car - Matlab
Imagine you're you're driving at a speed of 80 km/h in a one-way road and you're about to join a
new road. Even though you're usually an attentive driver, you're tired and are in an unfamiliar
area and fail to see a new sign that states "Danger: two way road ahead!". You're human, and
humans make mistakes. This could potentially lead to a fatal accident, all because you failed to
read a sign and assumed you're still driving in a one-way road. This is one example where failing
to see a traffic sign could have massive permanent negative consequences. This scenario is
amplified and is even more likely if you're an unexperienced or senior driver, or worse a driver
under influence.
To really illustrate the importance of this subject, take some time to process the fact that in 2018,
1.35 million deaths worldwide were caused by traffic accidents. Making it the number one cause
of death among children aged 5-14 and among young adults aged 15-29 .
Modern vehicles are in general safer and are equipped with ever more advanced safety systems
that have decreased road fatalities by a sizable amount. However, as the figures from 2018
show, there is still a lot to be improved.
With the auto industry inevitably moving towards automatization, detection, identification,
classification and distance management of traffic objects play a crucial role in the development of
such safety systems.
Maybe the scenario described earlier could simply be prevented by a vocal warning system that
would raise your attention to the changing road situation up ahead, even take preventive
measures when you fail to take action. We believe such a future is not too far ahead.
Our project focuses on a small part of this equation, we attempt to design a system which does
the following

1. Measures the distance to an (assumed) traffic object
2. When in proximity: classify the traffic object
